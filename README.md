## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with C on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

The project brings you a Makefile, command line options parsing, colors for pretty printing, [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) report and unittest using [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). 

The template was created by Gustavo Pantuza and for detailed informations, check out the [Documentation wiki](https://github.com/pantuza/c-project-template/wiki).
 
After cloning the repository you'll need to adjust `PROJECT_NAME` in the `project.conf` to match the name of your git repository.
